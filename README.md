Automated CI/CD workflows for Hugo sites with automatic updates and dependency management.

> **Note:** This project was primarily created with LLM Code and should be used with caution. Be aware of automation risks including cascading effects (workflows triggering each other), potential breaking changes from automatic updates, GitHub Actions resource consumption, and security considerations as workflows have permissions to modify repository content.

## Overview

Hugo Autopilot provides a set of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that automate the build, deployment, and maintenance of Hugo sites. These workflows can be referenced from your Hugo site repositories, allowing you to maintain your CI/CD configuration in a single place.

## Features & Workflows

Hugo Autopilot offers three reusable workflows combined into a single router workflow:

1. **Hugo Builder** (`hugo-builder.yml`) - Builds and deploys Hugo sites to GitHub Pages
   - Parameters: `base_branch`, `hugo_version_file`, `ignore_paths`, `enable_git_info`

2. **Hugo Updater** (`hugo-updater.yml`) - Checks for Hugo updates and creates PRs that are automerged to trigger rebuilds on newest Hugo-Version
   - Parameters: `hugo_version_file`, `update_branch`, `pr_title_prefix`

3. **PR Merger** (`pr-merger.yml`) - Auto-merges Dependabot PRs
   - Parameters: `merge_method`, `commit_message`

4. **Router** (`hugo-autopilot-router.yml`) - Routes events to the appropriate workflow based on the trigger
   - Combines all workflows into a single entry point

## Installation

To set up Hugo Autopilot for your Hugo site:

1. [ ] Create a `.hugoversion` file in your repository root with your Hugo version (e.g., `0.123.8`)
2. [ ] Copy the dependabot.yml template to your repository at `.github/dependabot.yml`
3. [ ] Create a single workflow file at `.github/workflows/hugo-autopilot.yml`
4. [ ] Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for your repository
5. [ ] Push changes to your repository

## Usage

To use Hugo Autopilot in your Hugo site repository, create a single workflow file:

### `.github/workflows/hugo-autopilot.yml`

```yaml
name: Hugo Autopilot

on:
  # Build triggers
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths-ignore:
      - 'import/**'  # Ignore changes to import directory
  
  # Update Hugo triggers
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday
  
  # Auto-merge triggers
  pull_request:
  
  # Manual trigger for all jobs
  workflow_dispatch:
  
  # Triggered by other workflows
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [trigger-hugo-build]

jobs:
  autopilot:
    uses: chriopter/hugo-autopilot/.github/workflows/hugo-autopilot-router.yml@main
    with:
      hugo_version_file: '.hugoversion'
      enable_git_info: true
      merge_method: 'squash'
```

This single workflow file handles all Hugo CI/CD tasks:
- Building and deploying your site on push to main
- Updating Hugo weekly and creating PRs
- Auto-merging Dependabot PRs
- Responding to manual triggers and repository dispatch events

## Example Implementation

For a real-world example of this workflow in action, see [christopher-eller.de](https://github.com/chriopter/christopher-eller.de), which uses a single `hugo-autopilot.yml` file to handle all CI/CD tasks.
